## **UX**
---

#### Goal was to build simple but effective website with features similar the mandalorian series so it will embodies the genre of the series.
#### This way; by simple eye catching and intuitive/interactive form which is already well known as beginner friendly, that allows us to get closer to the rest of the audience, even to those who never heard of Mandalore before.
#### Allowing the way for many others that will come... in the future.
#### By saying that, the secondary purpose of the website is to have all features that usually exist on separate platforms to unite them in One website that provides all that features form one place:
* Where to Watch
* Where to Buy
* Where to Followin
* Knowing about history and ideas forme screenwriters
* How is made
* Check the All news regard the Mandalorian series
#### *Hoping that this type of introduction will bring more people into the mandaloe genre.* 

#### General structure of Mandalore website conteins all parts needed for successful site starting with the:
     
#### My main two *wireframes* as a base form where did i start:
1. HTML/CSS Project [Love Running](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+CF101+2017_T1/courseware/1f0ccaac7a3e43d895c1beae5363f46c/8b3e9adaef764e1d962a85668c799cdd/?activate_block_id=block-v1%3ACodeInstitute%2BCF101%2B2017_T1%2Btype%40sequential%2Bblock%408b3e9adaef764e1d962a85668c799cdd) im using it as example: for html & css structure
2. Readme file as a blueprint taken from [NielMc github](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template)

#### Fonts 
   1. Lato = [Google Fonts Library](https://fonts.google.com/) as general
   2. Montserrat = [Google Fonts Library](https://fonts.google.com/)
   3. Mandalore = [Picture and Magic](https://www.picturethemagic.com/?s=mandalore) as maine title

#### img 
* All images and are links in the Technologies Used; section below

#### - One of my own goals as well was to try and keep structural integrity as much as a can, and try to squeeze braking points on minimum.
* more about that in details under Testing part  
#### Since as a Designer, i'm trying to provide all around functional structure, and form that will be able follow it and carry its visual signature through all screen sizes

### *Features Left to Implement*
---
* **I was trying so hard to push my main idea into realization** by having short delay of icons(main title/home,gallery,sign in buttons, etc) that will follow the beats from video in background on loope, and be able to pefomr hover effect after the delay effect is done, plus having a options thet will indicate by different color the page you are currently on
    * due to I wasted entire week trying to make that one part to work by trying from all different angels and not have success, it forces me to take simpler approach 
    
* among other staff, goal was to make all pages not just blank page "work in progres..", but i don't have enough time to create them all
* but idea again was simple:
  1. for How it Made.html goal was to make playable video intro of latest footag of mp4. format and it will take 70-80% of width and 40-60% max of hight as main attraction-so to say
     * under that will go all less intrested links and stories on evrything how did developers on set decided to film this series
  2. Info and Sell department, for them i was having something simple in mind = like simple list of hrfef's that leads to stores/history pages   
* and there is another issue or small mistake that i will not have time to settle, and that is in "Gallery" page: on hover all img that are near to borders are being cut off after animated part is done? I'm not sure what is causing that effect!

---
## **Technologies Used**
---

#### In this section, i will expose all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that I have used to construct The Mandalorian aka Milestone Project 1.
* **Using two maine languages for The Mandalorin project:**
  * HTML and CSS as base that is provided by [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
  * all Html and Css code are done in Gitpod by default in Code Institute University

* **My README file was taken as blueprint form [NielMc](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template) on GitHub**
  * it seams like a resanoable option to go with it, since it my first time doing it: why not go with an idea we are come to know as an option  
* **all images that are on maine page are processed in Photoshop, so they are all on my root file in hd.**

* **Gallery page it full of images that are taken form google search browser:**

* **FONTS:**
    1. Lato as general font taken form [Google Fonts Library](https://fonts.google.com/) 
       * as geenral font for all other paragraphs that are not Mandalore & WaltDisney 
    2. As the main font i pick mandalore font form [Picture and Magic](https://www.picturethemagic.com/?s=mandalore) and download the file on hd.
       * it was the only font that can do the mandalorian font!
         * and it differs from the rest of fonts
    3. Third and last font was Walt Disney font from [Picture and Magic](https://www.picturethemagic.com/free-disney-fonts/) again, and received and downloaded in same manner as mandalore fonte before
       * same reason way as previous font, because it represents the walt disney it self as a brand - better than anything els
* **Video:**
Video in background = [The Mandalorian | Season 2 Official Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW7Twd85m2g&t=12s) taken form [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) as source, and than croped and saved as on hd. and later upload to the assets/video folder

## **Testing**
---

#### *Responsive Elements*

##### First brakpoint at: @media screen and (max-width: 1016px) = quick pick section of 5 consecutive options, they are first one witch brakes structural visual integrity of a site!
   * Since my goal was to keep structural integrity of visual identity through all screen sizes
##### Second brakepoint and last one for my form was on (max-width: 552px) when my right side of menus are colliding with left side causing unpleasant visual disturbance.
   * And since that width it so close to phone size from that point on, I decided to translates it all smartphone sizes, since it only small gap of width: 100px max
#### In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
#### Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
#### For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
1. Contact form:
    * Go to the "Contact Us" page
    * Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    * Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
#### In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
#### Main focus was also how will the site look on other platforms, and general idea was not to differ more than the original idea, that started bigger screens
 * to maintain general vibe of so to say "vertically" align elements, from where they will transition into "horizontally" align elements
#### I should also mention in this section that *testing* was the only thing that i was doing it the whole time of the project: testing, testing and more testing -_#

---
## **Deployment**
---

#### This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
#### In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
* Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
* Different configuration files?
* Separate git branch?
#### In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

### **Idea**
* The idea of going with the Mandalorian series it purly becouze i love that series my self and that the area that im way more familiar than Musical bends or Gym, and third option: personal portfolio site (potentially for myrself) im keeping that one as last project.
* [YouTube the Mandalorian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW7Twd85m2g&t=12s) link for trailer as the source of my inspiration; since the original series i watch over the stream (and there is no point of linking that)
* not to mention that it’s close to my passion regarding art as Industrial designer, form which I also find ideas in SW triology
### **Content**
* The base for main structure in similar to structuro of [Love Running](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+CF101+2017_T1/courseware/1f0ccaac7a3e43d895c1beae5363f46c/8b3e9adaef764e1d962a85668c799cdd/?activate_block_id=block-v1%3ACodeInstitute%2BCF101%2B2017_T1%2Btype%40sequential%2Bblock%408b3e9adaef764e1d962a85668c799cdd) from where i take mouste of structural frames
* Readme file was taken as blueprint from where i started and modified a tiny bit [NielMc](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template) on GitHub
### **Media**
* **img files** are seperated in 2 sections:
    * the one that are remake by myself - root folder source = only visible on main page
