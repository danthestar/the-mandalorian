## **Structure of the website**
---
FFA, so all  media query are covered and the simplistic styling is detained on all platforms: desktop, tablet or mobile device.
Simple but effective.

##### First brakpoint at: @media screen and (max-width: 1016px) = quick pick section of 5 consecutive options, they are first one witch brakes structural visual integrity of a site!
   * Since my goal was to keep structural integrity of visual identity through all screen sizes
##### Second brakepoint and last one for my form was on (max-width: 552px) when my right side of menus are colliding with left side causing unpleasant visual disturbance.
   * And since that width it so close to phone size from that point on, I decided to translates it all smartphone sizes, since it only small gap of width: 100px max

Beginner friendly, intuitive with moderate tones that do not strain the pupils further after a long stay.

Interaction interface so all buttons and links have one or two interactive effects.

### *Features Left to Implement*
---
* **I was trying so hard to push my main idea into realization** by having short delay of icons(main title/home,gallery,sign in buttons, etc) that will follow the beats from video in background on loope, and be able to pefomr hover effect after the delay effect is done, plus having a options thet will indicate by different color the page you are currently on
    * due to I wasted entire week trying to make that one part to work by trying from all different angels and not have success, it forces me to take simpler approach 
    
* among other staff, goal was to make all pages not just blank page "work in progres..", but i don't have enough time to create them all
* idea again was simple:
  1. for How it Made.html goal was to make playable video intro of latest footag of mp4. format and it will take 70-80% of width and 40-60% max of hight as main attraction-so to say
     * under that will go all less intrested links and stories on evrything how did developers on set decided to film this series
  2. Info and Sell department, for them i was having something simple in mind = like simple list of hrfef's that leads to stores/history pages   
* and there is another issue or small mistake that i will not have time to settle, and that is in "Gallery" page: on hover all img that are near to borders are being cut off after animated part is done? I'm not sure what is causing that effect!

### **Idea**
* The idea of going with the Mandalorian series it purly becouze i love that series my self and that the area that im way more familiar than Musical bends or Gym, and third option: personal portfolio site (potentially for myrself) im keeping that one as last project.
* [YouTube the Mandalorian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW7Twd85m2g&t=12s) link for trailer as the source of my inspiration; since the original series i watch over the stream (and there is no point of linking that)
* not to mention that it’s close to my passion regarding art as Industrial designer, form which I also find ideas in SW triology
### **Content**
* The base for main structure in similar to structuro of [Love Running](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+CF101+2017_T1/courseware/1f0ccaac7a3e43d895c1beae5363f46c/8b3e9adaef764e1d962a85668c799cdd/?activate_block_id=block-v1%3ACodeInstitute%2BCF101%2B2017_T1%2Btype%40sequential%2Bblock%408b3e9adaef764e1d962a85668c799cdd) from where i take mouste of structural frames
